/**
 * \mainpage Resource Policy Library
 *
 * \section intro_section Introduction
 *
 * This library is used to request resources from the Policy Resource Manager.
 * To use this library two classes are provided: \ref ResourcePolicy::Resource and
 * \ref ResourcePolicy::ResourceSet.
 *
 * \section library_use_section Library Usage
 *
 * To use the Resource Policy Library, you first need to create the
 * \ref ResourcePolicy::ResourceSet like this:
 * \code
 * ResourcePolicy::ResourceSet *resources = new ResourcePolicy::ResourceSet("player");
 * \endcode
 * Then to add resources to the set use the ResourceSet::addResource() method to add
 * resources to the ResourcePolicy::ResourceSet. Like this:
 * \code
 * resources->addResource(AudioPlaybackType);
 * resources->addResource(VideoPlaybackType);
 * \endcode
 * If you want to pre-populate the AudioResource with the audio group (it is a good idea)
 * and other audio parameters you can create an audio object yourself and then
 * give that to the ResourcePolicy::ResourceSet. Note that you should NOT free this object.
 * The ResourcePolicy::ResourceSet takes ownership of this pointer.
 * \code
 * ResourcePolicy::AudioResource *audioResource = new ResourcePolicy::AudioResource("player");
 * resources->addResourceObject(audioResource);
 * \endcode
 * Calling the ResourcePolicy::ResourceSet::deleteResource() method will remove
 * and delete the object. Then when you want to acquire the ResourcePolicy::ResourceSet
 * you simply use the ResourcePolicy::ResourceSet::acquire() method, like this:
 * \code
 * QObject::connect(resources, SIGNAL(resourcesAcquired()),
 *                  this, SLOT(acquireOkHandler(QList<ResourcePolicy::Resource>)));
 * QObject::connect(resources, SIGNAL(resourcesDenied()), this, SLOT(acquireDeniedHandler()));
 * resources->acquire();
 * \endcode
 * You should also connect to the ResourcePolicy::ResourceSet::lostResources() signal like this:
 * \code
 * QObject::connect(resources, SIGNAL(lostResources()),
 *                  this, SLOT(lostResources()));
 * \endcode
 * This signal tells you when you should stop using the resources you have asked for.
 * So it is important that you connect to it.
 *
 * To modify the properties of the resources you can use the ResourcePolicy::ResourceSet::resource() method.
